Welcome to OpenTidalFarm
========================

OpenTidalFarm is an open-source software for simulating and optimising tidal
turbine farms.

The positioning of the turbines in a tidal farm is a crucial decision.
Simulations show that the optimal positioning can increase the power generation
of the farm by up to 50% and can therefore determine the viability of a project.
However, finding the optimal layout is a difficult process due to the complex
flow interactions. OpenTidalFarm solves this problem by applying an efficient
optimisation algorithm onto a accurate flow prediction model.

Following presentation gives a quick introduction to OpenTidalFarm:
