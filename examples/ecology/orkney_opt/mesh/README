To make the mesh you need to:

1) Download gshhs from 
http://rapidshare.com/files/2456623489/gshhs_f.b
and place it into the mesh/ directory
2) Open box_orkney.geo with gmsh, select Tools -> Plugins -> GSHHS.
Then:
* Change the InFileName to fshhs_i.b
* Change the OutFileName to earth_orkney.geo
* Change iField to 2
* Change WritePolarSphere to 0
Click on Run
3) Open the generated file earth.geo to see if the contours are correct.
4) Convert the stereographic coordinates into a flat domain: 
   >> python convert.py earth_orkney.geo 
   Open earth_orkney_converted.geo and check that the results are good looking.
5) Add the boundary box points and add physical ids
6) Open up the .geo file and delete the last column (the mesh spacing value) of the newly added points
7) Add a background field that specifies the mesh size:
      Field[2] = MathEval;
      Field[2].F = "1e+03";
      Background Field = 2;
